# Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to create some usefull functions based on popular algorithms, with the aim of practice programming and implement the mathematics behind these methods.

Some of the algorithms developed in this repository are from the courses of the Masters degree in statistics for data science in the uc3m and some other from the book Machine Learning from scratch of the author Jason Brownlee. This book offers algorithms in raw python code with the aim of learning the mathematics behind the algorithms. The aim of this repository is not to offer the algorithms to users, it is pure didactical for myself.
