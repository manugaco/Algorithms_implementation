# Algorithms

Some of the algorithms developed in this repository are from the courses of the Masters degree in statistics for data science at the uc3m and some others from the book Machine Learning from scratch of the author Jason Brownlee. This book offers algorithms in raw python code with the aim of learning the mathematics behind the algorithms. There are some other algorithms from leet code and finally, own creations.

The aim of this repository is not to offer the algorithms to users, it is pure didactical for myself, practice different programming languages such as C++, R, Python and Julia.
